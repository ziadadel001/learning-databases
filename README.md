#  Database Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning **different database systems**, starting from a strong **MySQL / PHP background**.

Each database is studied individually, with:
- Core concepts
- Basic & advanced commands
- Query examples
- Strengths & weaknesses
- A direct comparison with **MySQL**

The goal is to clearly understand **when and why** to use each database.

---

##  Why This Repository?

Coming from a **MySQL + PHP** background, I wanted to:
- Understand how modern databases work
- Learn **NoSQL and non-relational concepts**
- Compare every database with MySQL to build intuition
- Create a long-term reference for real projects

---
## Databases Covered

| Database      | Type                        | Status      |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| MySQL         | Relational (SQL)            | ✅ Covered   |
| MongoDB       | NoSQL (Document)            | ✅ Completed |
| SQLite        | Relational (Embedded SQL)   | ✅ Completed |
| PostgreSQL    | Relational (SQL)            | ✅ Completed |
| Firebase      | NoSQL (Document/Realtime)   | ✅ Completed |
| Neo4j         | Graph Database              | ✅ Completed |


##  Learning Methodology

For every database, I focus on:

1. How the database works internally
2. Data structure & storage model
3. Query syntax & examples
4. Indexing & performance basics
5. When to use it in real-world applications
6. Comparison with **MySQL**

---

##  Why Compare Everything to MySQL?

- MySQL is widely used in PHP applications
- It provides a solid relational baseline
- Comparing helps highlight **trade-offs**
- Makes decision-making easier in real projects

---

##  Target Audience

- Backend developers
- PHP developers moving beyond MySQL
- Anyone learning databases conceptually
- Developers preparing for system design interviews

---

##  Notes

- This is a **learning repository**, not production documentation
- Examples are simplified for clarity
- Content will evolve as learning progresses
